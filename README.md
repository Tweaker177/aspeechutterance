# aspeechutterance
Just a simple, sample program that takes a text string, in this case an "epic rap battle" between JESUS AND DONALD TRUMP, generated by EZCompleteOSX, 
my MacOS version of EZComplete, a multi-model highly customizable GPT3 ageent.  I made this to help in debegguging the text to speech useage added to EZComplete and EZCompleteOSSX.
A SPEECH UTTERANCE is a theos-made project, but it doen't use mobilie substrate or hook anything.  It's only depends are AVFoundation, Foundation, and AppKit, 
and the build is for MACOS, minimum OSX version is 10.14 (Some of the more complicated or cutting edge Speech frameworks were just recently made available in iOS and OSX 16.5 (don't quote me on the iOS version, just know the mac OS requires the latest firmwares)

It works inside Terminal as well as VSCode and other Terminal / Shell environements.   The AVSpeechSynthesizer class is part of the native AVFoundation.h, so no additional headers are needed to work.

If this helped you learn how to use Apple's free text to speech framework, for both iOS and MacOS, please consider leaving a star, updating the string to a variable string to make the output more interesting, and don't forget to give a star.
