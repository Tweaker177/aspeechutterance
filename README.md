# aSpeechUtterance
Just a simple, sample program that takes a text string, in this case an "epic rap battle" between JESUS AND DONALD TRUMP, generated by EZCompleteOSX, 
my MacOS version of EZComplete, a multi-model highly customizable GPT3 ageent.  I made this to help in debegguging the text to speech useage added to EZComplete and EZCompleteOSSX.

## aSpeechUtterance is a theos-made project, but it doen't use mobilie substrate or hook anything.  It's only depends are AVFoundation, Foundation, and AppKit, 
and the build is for MACOS, minimum OSX version is 10.14 (Some of the more complicated or cutting edge Speech frameworks were just recently made available in iOS and OSX 16.5, don't quote me on the iOS version, just know the mac OS requires the latest firmwares)

### It works inside Terminal as well as VSCode and other Terminal / Shell environements.   The AVSpeechSynthesizer class is part of the native AVFoundation.h, so no additional headers are needed to work.  I tested a build for iOS installed on 14.2 and it worked perfectly (as expected, I think perfectly is going to require switching to Google's API's).  I could slow down the speed though and it would sound a little better.  The nice thing about Apple's API obviously is that it is free on iOS and OSX.

### If this helped you learn how to use Apple's free text to speech framework, for both iOS and MacOS, please consider leaving a star, updating the string to a variable string to make the output more interesting, and don't forget to give a star.


Note: if you would like for this to build a deb instead, to use on jailbroken iOS environments on iOS 16, change the "macos" to "iphoneos" in the makefile, and use "UIKit/UIKit.h instead of <AppKit/AppKit.h>
Also, add ASPEECHUTTTERANCE_CODESIGN_FLAGS = -sEntitlements.plist -Icom.i0stweak3r.aspeechutterance to the makefile and it should work.  Have only tested on Mac OS though.

## Useage:  Open Terminal on Mac or inside VSCode or any other shell / zsh environment, then type: "aSpeechUtterance" (no quotes)  It will run through the rap battle between Jesus and Trump, and append a number after indicating where it is in the loop, and showing that the modification of the string did not mess up the utterance. (Once an utterance string is created it can not be modified, so you need to be a little creative in where and how you create new utterance strings so they contain everything you need to speak what you want, when you want.)    

### The program loops through apppending up to "9" at the end, or if you type exit it will quit immediately.   Useage is the same for iOS, just open NewTerm or MobileTerminal after installing. iOS build is for rootful jailbreaks (regular jailbreaks like Taurine, Uncover, etc).  Will eventually migrate these into an app that doesnt require a JB, but for simple stuff like this it seems pointless.
