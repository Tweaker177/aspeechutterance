# aspeechutterance
Just a simple, sample program that takes a text string, in this case an "epic rap battle" between JESUS AND DONALD TRUMP, generated by EZCompleteOSX, 
my MacOS version of EZComplete, a multi-model highly customizable GPT3 ageent.  I made this to help in debegguging the text to speech useage added to EZComplete and EZCompleteOSSX.
A SPEECH UTTERANCE is a theos-made project, but it doen't use mobilie substrate or hook anything.  It's only depends are AVFoundation and and Foundation, and AppKit, 
and the build is for MACOS.  It works inside Terminal as well as VSCode and other Terminal / Shell environements.   The AVSpeechSynthesizer class is part of the native AVFoundation.h, so no additional 
headers are needed to work.
